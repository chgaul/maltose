# The following dataset contains structures of 80 non-fullerene acceptors from
# the paper Kuzmich et al. (2017), DOI: 10.1039/C6EE03654F.
# The geometries are optimzed at the DFT/B3LYP/6-31G* level.
# Some properties (LUMO, LUMO+1) are provided in the paper
# (Table 1 of Kuzmich_2017_TrendsNFA), use the "Acceptor's label" to join this
# table with the zipped xyz files.
# Further, reported PCEs of acceptor donor pairs are given in the table.
